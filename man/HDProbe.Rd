\arguments{
\item{Muts_df}{A dataframe in the form required by HDProbe}

\item{nreps}{Integer; Number of replicates}

\item{homosked}{Logical; if TRUE, then the slope of the mean-variance relationship is set to 0}

\item{bg_pval}{Numeric; p-value cutoff for calling a nt's mutation rate as being no greater than the background error rate}

\item{bg_rate}{Numeric; background mutation rate assumed}

\item{alpha_p}{Numeric; shape1 of the beta prior used for mutation rate estimation. If alpha_p or beta_p are NULL, then this is
estimated using beta distribution method of moments estimator}

\item{beta_p}{Numeric; shape2 of the beta prior used for mutation rate estimation. If alpha_p or beta_p are NULL, then this
is estimated using beta distribution method of moments estimator}

\item{filter_het}{Numeric; number of sites that need to make it past variance trend estimation read count
filtering when using heteroskedastic variance model (homosked = FALSE).}

\item{filter_hom}{Numeric; number of sites that need to make it past variance trend estimation read count
filtering when using homoskedastic variance model (homosked = TRUE).}

\item{One_ctl}{Logical; if TRUE, then mutation rate comparisons are made to the global average control sample mutation
rate}

\item{Gene_ctl}{Logical; if TRUE, then mutation rate comparisons are made to the
gene-wide average control sample mutation rate}

\item{var_of_var}{Variance of variance to be used to tune regularization. If NULL, this
is estimated empirically (i.e., from the data)}

\item{prior_slope}{If homosked is FALSE, RV trend slope to use if not enough sites
make it past filtering for determining trend.}

\item{prior_int_hom}{If homosked is TRUE, RV trend intercept to use if not enough sites make it past read count
filtering for determining trend.}

\item{prior_int_het}{If homosked is FALSE, RV trend intercept to use if not enough sites
make it past filtering for determining trend.}

\item{Normalize}{Set the 75\% percentile of mutation rates equal across samples}

\item{...}{Parameters that can be supplied to internal functions}
